    <title>My major and My minor</title>

<p> For the Longest time I wanted to be an engineer, until my sophomore year of highschool.</p>
<p> My sophomore year I started DECA which is a business competition that involves a written test and a roleplay.</p>
<p> I learned that I loved business and more specifically marketing. Im still on the fence about what I want to minor in however.</p>
<p> My senior year I did an internship for an online marketing agency, I never had an interest in computer science until my internship.</p>
<p> I learned a lot about SEO and the traffic a website gets form various sources and it may cause me to get my minor in computer science</p>
<p> My internship also taught me that not all workspaces are serious and always down to business and it taught me that I wanted to work in a goofey work place.</p>
