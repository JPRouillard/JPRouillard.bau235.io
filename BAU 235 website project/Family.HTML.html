<p> My little sister Alex is a sophmore in highschool a level 8 gymnast for the YMCA Wildcats in Beverly Massachusets.</p>
<IMG SRC="IMG_1478.JPG">
<p> Last year in 2017 she won the nations level seven competition and was the best level seven gymnast in the country.</p>
<p> The coolest part is that she managed to win even with an injured ankle which happen on her first event of the day.</p>
