    <title>Skiing addiction</title>

<body>
<p> I would say I have a skiing addiction. I learned to snow ski when I was about 3 years old, and I learned to water ski at 4.</p>
<p> Although I do love to snow ski, Slalom skiing is much more my style, literally</p>
<p> Slalom skiing takes real balance and really extending your body to turn the ski.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that there is nothing like getting sling shot across a wake at close to 50mph</p>
